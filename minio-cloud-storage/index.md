## What is Minio

Minio is a lightweight object storage server released under Apache License v2.0. It is compatible with Amazon S3 cloud storage service. It is best suited for storing unstructured data such as photos, videos, log files, backups and container / VM images. Size of an object can range from a few KBs to a maximum of 5TB. Minio has advanced features like erasure code, bitrot protection and lambda functions. Application developers often deploy Minio in a dockerized container and orchestrate it with Kubernetes.

Minio server is light enough to be bundled with the application stack, similar to Node JS, Redis and MySQL.
